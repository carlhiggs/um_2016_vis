# Urban Monitor data visualisation for Greater Sydney region (2016)

## About
This R Shiny interactive map visualisation of tree coverage percentage for Greater Sydney region (2016) was created using Urban Monitor data for a 2019 consultancy through the Centre for Urban Research at RMIT University with Joe Hurley for the NSW State Government.  The data itself is not included in this repository, which contains the code used for the interactive application itself; now archived for posterity.

## Problem Statement
The Urban Monitor data is very granular, but requires aggregation to allow meaningful digestion.  It is felt that an interactive web app, allowing consideration of 'any tree %' stratified by public / private / and other land use at LGA and SA1 scales will highlight the rich potential for this data.  We'll find out if we create it and see for ourselves.

## Scope
### Must have:

- interactivity
- LGA aggregation
- public / private /other stratification pie chart

### Nice to have:

- SA1 aggregation
- switch indicators
- data filter
