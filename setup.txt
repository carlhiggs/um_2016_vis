:::: NOTES
::  shp file for the vegetation and land-use data; an excel file of the data with a pivot table set up; and the metadata.
::  Some key fields:
::  CompleteData_YN = Y (this filters out incomplete data coverage)
::  MUA_Ind         = 1 or 2 (this includes only land considered by state gov or ABS as urban).
::  PerAnyTree       (% tree cover (all veg over 3m)). I would stick with this vegetation measure and not worry about others for now.
::  MB_Reclass       (Land use code from ABS with the addition of our ‘infrastructure’ code, which is the street and rail corridors)
::  Public_Private (groups MB_Reclass into either Public, Private or Other. This is in the excel file, but not the shp file for some reason)
